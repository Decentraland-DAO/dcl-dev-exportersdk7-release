## Unity Exporter Toolkit for Decentraland SDK7
Boost your Decentraland creations with this set of tools and setups to speed up your development. This package allows your team to work under the Decentraland SDK7 specs while maintaining a more dev-friendly approach closer to game and app development.
The tool is able to export your Unity scene creations and translate all the content into Decentraland SDK7 project data. It doesn't work with SDK6 projects so be careful when migrating!

This project has been created and curated by Polygonal Mind with the support of the Decentraland DAO.

Check the [docs](https://polygonalmind.github.io/dcl-dev-exportersdk7-release/) to learn in-depth about the tool and all the capabilities unleashed with it.
